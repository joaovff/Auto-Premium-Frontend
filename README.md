# Reflection
At the end of the day, it was a pleasure to develop Auto Premium because there is passion for cars.
There were some challenges during the development of the project, such as authentication and the rendering of the map based on the location entered by the user, but all the goals set at the beginning of the project were achieved and some unplanned features came to life as ideas emerged.
